- Welcome to this presentation on Solid. I'm going to introduce you what Solid is all about and give you some thoughts of mine on how it is interoperable with blockchain technologies.

# About me

- inrupt is co-founded by CEO John Bruce and CTO Sir Tim Berners-Lee
- The sole purpose of inrupt is to make Solid widely adopted by developers, businesses and eventually - everyone

# Web@30

- The web is celebrating its 30th year anniversary this year
- It started in 1989 when Sir Tim Berners-Lee wrote a document at CERN called “Information Management: A proposal”.
- It described a global hypertext system that allowed for the exchange of documents
- He was initially allowed to work on it as a side-project. But from that project came what we today know as the web
- Today, over half the global population is on the web
- The web is designed to be universal - anyone can access it from any device
- It is a set of open standards that allows anyone to develop for the web, without permission - we call this permissionless innovation

# Permissionless innovation

- Permissionless innovation means that you don't have to ask anyone for permission to publish content and services on the web, and 
- this has been the fertile ground that major tech companies have been founded on
- But sadly it seems that many of these tech giants are now dragging up the ladder behind them, forcing content creators to publish content and communicate through their services
- The name of the game seems to be “who can get the most data about people so that advertisements can be targeted more efficient”
- This incentivizes actors to be data hoarders and create persuasion architectures - services that makes it very hard for people to move their data around
- This ecosystem favors the winners, and forces newcomers to participate on the premises of the most popular services - stiffling innovation

# Solid

- Solid tries to solve a lot of these problems
- It is a new project from Tim Berners-Lee where he wants to flip how personal data is handled on the web
- It’s based on a simple idea: “People should be in control of their personal data”
- Solid is many things
  - An abbreviation on Solid Linked Data
  - A set of open standards
  - Several implementations of said standards - Servers and client applications
  - A social movement of people interested in solving problems using Solid technologies
  - An ecosystem of services (something inrupt is heavily invested in)
- When it comes down to it, Solid is just another layer on the existing web
  - With some extra standards
- JSON-LD, Turtle, HTML+RDFa, XML/RDF
- A decentralized identity (e.g. https://megoth.inrupt.net/profile/card#me)
- A pod
- Ability to control access to your data
- A separation of data and applications
- Verifiable credentials
- Application registry and access management
- Data discovery
- Shapes

# Decentralize all the data

- Author name and latest profile picture - stored in author's personal data pod
- Work-related opinion about an article - stored in data pod of author's company
- Discussed article title and photo - stored in news website's data pod
- Likes on this post - each one in different individuals' data pods
- Comments on this post - each one in different individuals' data pods

# Reuse data across applications

# Create new ways of innovation

- app market
- data market

# Blockchain

- Is still a very much unbroken terrain
- A lot of shared philosophies
  - The most prominent is, I believe, the wish to decentralize and create other models of trust
- Blockchain technologies can have a lot of overhead if you try to reinvent the wheel
  - Maybe just use the existing web - URIs are universal, after all
  - Maybe use Solid for decentralized identity, storage and authorization
- An interesting example from the international blockchain & AI hackaton called Odyssey, where there was a challenge by the dutch Ministry of Justice and Security to build an open-source, decentralized and government backed protocol for registering and communicating digital permissions
  - The winning team - a german team called A Solid Team - created a universal, reusable and privacy-oriented protocol to approve, manage and revoke digital permissions.
  - They used Solid pods as storage
  - Linked data to decouple data from applications
  - Created a vocabulary that standardized permission requests
  - They used blockchain technologies to make sure that they weren't depending on any centralized authority
