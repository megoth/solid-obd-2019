# About me

- inrupt is co-founded by CEO John Bruce and CTO Sir Tim Berners-Lee
- The sole purpose of inrupt is to make Solid widely adopted by developers, businesses and eventually - everyone

# Web@30

- In March of 1989, Sir Tim Berners-Lee wrote a proposal at CERN called “Information Management: A proposal”
- Over half the global population is on the web
- The web is universal, a set of open standards that allows anyone to develop for the web, without permission - we call this permissionless innovation

# Permissionless innovation

- Tech giants have taken advantage of this permissionless innovation
- But many of them are dragging up the ladder behind them, forcing content creators to publish content and communicate through their services
- The name of the game seems to be “who can get the most data about people so that advertisements can be targeted more efficient”
- This leads to adverse effects such as data hoarding and persuasion architectures - services that makes it very hard for people to move their data around, and in effect creates a lot of redundant data
- As the saying goes “If you’re not paying for the product, you’re the product”

# Solid

- Solid is a new project from Sir Tim Berners-Lee where he wants to flip how personal data online is handled on the web
- Solid is an abbreviation on Solid Linked Data (which for some might hint of its background with Semantic Web)
- It’s based on a simple premiss: “People should be in control of their personal data”
- And a simple idea: “People should be able to tell service providers where their data should be stored”
- Solid is many things
  - A set of open standards
  - Servers and client applications
  - A social group of people interested in solving common problems
  - A movement
  - An ecosystem of services
  - Another layer on the existing web
- JSON-LD, Turtle, HTML+RDFa, XML/RDF
- A decentralized identity (e.g. https://megoth.inrupt.net/profile/card#me)
- A pod
- Ability to control access to your data
- A separation of data and applications
- Verifiable credentials
- Application registry and access management
- Data discovery
- Encryption
- Shapes

# Decentralize all the data

- Author name and latest profile picture - stored in author's personal data pod
- Work-related opinion about an article - stored in data pod of author's company
- Discussed article title and photo - stored in news website's data pod
- Likes on this post - each one in different individuals' data pods
- Comments on this post - each one in different individuals' data pods

# Reuse data across applications

# Create new ways of innovation

- app market
- data market

# Blockchain

- Is still a very much unbroken terrain
- A lot of shared philosophies
  - The most prominent is, I believe, the wish to decentralize and create other models of trust
- Blockchain technologies can have a lot of overhead if you try to reinvent the wheel
  - Maybe just use the existing web - maybe use Solid?
- An interesting example from the international blockchain & AI hackaton called Odyssey, where there was a challenge by the dutch Ministry of Justice and Security to build an open-source, decentralized and government backed protocol for registering and communicating digital permissions
  - The winning team - a german team called A Solid Team - created a universal, reusable and privacy-oriented protocol to approve, manage and revoke digital permissions.
  - They used Solid pods as storage
  - Linked data to decouple data from applications
  - Created a vocabulary that standardized permission requests
  - They used blockchain technologies to make sure that they weren't depending on any centralized authority
